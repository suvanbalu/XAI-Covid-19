# covid-dataset-for-xai
Created a compound dataset using python for finding covid factors using XAI 

The dataset used in this research was a combination of different datasets such as the covid-19 cases [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india) from where the confirmed case till Dec-31-2021 for three states Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were taken and new cases were found by shifting and subtracting the confirmed cases. Temperature and humidity datasets were taken from [rp5](https://rp5.ru/Weather_in_India) and combined with the respective dates of the new cases dataset. 


Part 2 will be pushed once our research paper is published !
